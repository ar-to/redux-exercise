# Redux Exercise

I used the following resources for reference:

- [learncodeacademy - videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucd5x3Ka3gw)

and [source code](https://github.com/learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials)

## Getting Started

`yarn run dev' starts dev server with hot reloading and watches for changes in src/

This repo has code for [redux chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) to manage state changes and debugging.
